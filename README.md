I'm using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) for package management

choco install zulu11 intellijidea-community androidstudio android-sdk

- zulu11 is the java SDK I chose
- intellij idea is the libGDX recommended IDE, but I think we could use eclipse if we wanted to
- androidstudio and android-sdk are just in case we want to try running on android
